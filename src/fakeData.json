With its macho look, which Honda was able to achieve by using bulky body panels, especially the fuel tank, Honda plans to target buyers who are style conscious. While the fascia still reminds us of the CB Unicorn Dazzler, the side profile is the best way to look at this motorcycle. The rear of the CB Hornet 160R also stands out thanks to the X-shaped tail lamp. In addition to this, it gets an LED headlamp, and a hazard light switch where one would ordinarily have got an engine killswitch.",
